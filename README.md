# Covidaway: Covid Act: Watch it Approaching You

An app to track the approach of covid on the graph of network connections including you and those you spend time with.

Below is an email between Tom Veatch and Yew Tai Pan:

I agree with the author (Po Shen Loh?) Great great idea. I'm very enthusiastic.
However, politicians have their head up their ass and won't listen to technical solutions, according to my experience.  For example California's long drought didn't enable California politicians to give any reasonable attention to my technical solution, instead I got the bureaucratic brush-off, in a way very similar to what is seen in this.  So that may be the conclusion in Singapore for PSL also. 
However, the implementation of this amounts to a simple web app front-end with messaging and a cloud database, so a technical solution bypassing political gatekeeping is available: just code up the app and deploy it.  I could almost do it myself; certainly I could write the specification, if someone else hasn't already.  In fact I do so, below.  Then if people just start using it, it can take over the world without government support required.
As I see it in my imagination, the app should have a very few screens: 
1) an enrollment screen where you give your information, perhaps no more than your home town, and initiate your DB entry.  
2) a self-status-update display where you tell it when you have a positive test result.
3) a self-status-display being a circle with covid cases on the perimeter and self at center, and radiating branching links between center and perimeter of the circle.  When the number of links between center and edge become few, the person is at higher risk.
4) a share-the-app page where you send messages to the people you spend time with.  It will ask them to get the app too, in order to protect themselves and also keep you informed if they test positive.  Altruism for those people adds to self-protection as motivation to enroll. 

Other issues: 

Perhaps users would be allowed to know the names one link away but not more than one; some privacy policy is implied: what options? what default?  This implies a Settings page in addition to the above.  Attention is required on the privacy issue prevent potential bad outcomes for enrollees. If no privacy, a sick person may be abandoned and ostracized, for example. 
It will benefit the app to track enrolled people in the physical proximity of each other, so bluetooth enablement and automatic handshake would be an important feature to add. But that can wait for version 2.0 since the system would have benefit even without such automatic data collection.
It may benefit users to report their vaccination status, previous infection and symptom history, virus version detected, etc. It would certainly benefit science and produce useful data for exploratory epidemiological research on this pandemic; also users could see the evolving results they contributed to in a constructive feedback loop.   
Yes I like it very much.
Shall I make a github page for this and request others to help out?  Okay, I did so, github.com/tcveatch/covidaway

Do you want to forward this to po@novid.com? Feel free to connect us.  But perhaps he has done all this and more long ago -- I don't see any dates on your forwarded message.
But yes, I like the idea and I consider it practical and powerful in principle.  Every motivated initial user should be the center of his or her own network of protection, motivated to get all of their personal network of others to enroll.  So it has the rapidest possible adoption rate built in.  Great, great.

Best,

Tom

Hi Dr.Thomas,
What is your take ?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Po-Shen Loh :Dear PM Lee, I'm the mathematician you communicated with on Facebook about 2 years ago, when you posted the simpler way of solving quadratic equations that I found. 
I'm a Carnegie Mellon math professor and the National Coach of the USA Math Olympiad team, and a Combinatorialist by training. 
Over the last year, I have invented a new approach to controlling pandemics, powered by Game Theory and Graph Theory. I think it would be particularly powerful in the Singaporean context (based upon my understanding of culture from my parents, who grew up in Singapore). I would love to work with you and Singapore on this new category of tool.
It is fundamentally different from contact tracing, and is based upon aligning incentives so that even selfish behavior contributes to pandemic control. I would love to speak with you about this if you are interested, because I am sure that with your mathematical background, you would grasp it immediately, and see how it brings more power than other approaches used thus far.
The key concept starts off quite simple. It is a smartphone app that helps the app user directly reduce their own chance of getting infected, by telling them the graph-theoretic distance between each new positive case and them. (In contrast, standard apps are designed to make the app user not infect other people.) This is radar, but for pandemics, against the metric space of graph-theoretic distance. Its messages can be communicated in plain language: "someone just tested positive, and they frequently spend time with someone who frequently spends time with someone who frequently spends time with you." (Distance 3.) However, the breakthrough is that by showing people how this graph-theoretic distance changes over time (just like radar), each individual person (who seeks to avoid infection) naturally raises their guard as the infection strikes nearer and nearer.
This is a completely different mechanism than contact tracing. Standard contact tracing is top-down, and by the time it involves an individual, they are asked to take actions to protect everyone else from them. Our approach works bottom-up (analogously to a free market economy instead of a command economy): the individual is empowered to protect themself from everyone else.
This system could help maintain economic and border activity, by making each individual resident more resistant to getting infected, so that even if cases enter the country, they are less able to spread.
I've been discussing this concept with many scientists over the past year. The technical paper describing the theoretical foundation of the concept is at 
Flipping the Perspective in Contact Tracinghttps://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.03806.pdfand it has even been implemented into an app (www.novid.org), 
although it would be a pleasure and an honor to work with your government's app as well. The scientific community has been receptive as well. Surprisingly, this is an entirely new mechanism for pandemic control, even though it is so simple in retrospect.
Lee Hsien LoongThanks for sharing your interesting idea! I've passed this to the team at GovTech to take a closer look. Hope you are keeping well. – LHL

Po-Shen LohDear PM Lee Hsien Loong, thank you very much for replying to me personally. It is an honor to be able to communicate with you. I understand you are very busy. I spoke with GovTech about a year ago, as well as MOH, but at that time, the pandemic was not so severe in Singapore. I feel that your leadership could play an important role though, to prevent this type of invention from slipping between the cracks, as technologists and public health experts tend to respect their separate domains of expertise.
If anyone from your team (with a background like yours, and who can see deep into a new concept) would be interested in talking to me, I’d be honored to explain. There is very significant depth to this new approach, which most people do not grasp at first glance. 
I’m happy to be reached at po@novid.org
This has the potential to revolutionize how human civilization responds to pandemics. It would be an honor and pleasure to work with Singapore to deploy the first game-theoretically aligned pandemic control system, and lead the world to show how it should be done.
